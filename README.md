- 👋 Hi, I’m @Al-ph-A
- 👀 I’m interested in app/game dev
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python fundamentals (still a major NOOB) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone 
that might also be new or a pro willing to adopt
their own padawan 😁
- 📫 How to reach me: 
Well hopefully through GitHub or whatsapp I guess?🤔
